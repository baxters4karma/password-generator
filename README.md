## Description

This week’s Challenge involves creating an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by the JavaScript code. It will have a clean and polished user interface and is responsive, which ensures that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

ASCII character codes used within coding of this project were found here: [American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) table website](https://theasciicode.com.ar/).

Coding from [Traversy Media's *JavaScript Password Generator*](#credits) tutorial was incorporated into project while keeping existing starter code and mock design.

Employee will use this application to generate a random password based on user-selected criteria. Employee(s) will run the application's clean and polished user interface within the browser, ensuring responsiveness is built in for adaption to multiple screen sizes.

Please note this website was designed with a mobile-first mindset and uses the following media queries for responsive display on mobile phone and tablet screens:
* Mobile Phones (max-width = 500px)
* Tablets (max-width = 690px)
